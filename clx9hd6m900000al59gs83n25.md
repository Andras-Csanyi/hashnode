In GraphQL solutions [Errors as Data approach](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/technotes/TN0041-errors-as-data-explained/) provides more expressiveness to the api. This is the promise and this article is not about this, but about what setup is needed and what tools exist to make it easy dealing with this approach.

Beside the fact that this approach requires wrapping you head around it a bit, it might bring some pain because the union type will be an interface. Transforming an interface to json is can be pain with FasterXML.

We have two options: using a **code generator** or maintaining the java side **by hand**.

The solutions below show only the relevant part of the code. You may find the whole project at the solutions.

Let's consider the following super minimal GraphQL Api. Nothing fancy. A **union** type which can be either a result or an error.

```graphql
type Query{
    getArticlesSuccess: ArticleResult!
    getArticlesError: ArticleResult!
}

union ArticleResult = ArticleOutput | SomeError

type ArticleOutput {
    articles: [Article]
}

type Article {
    id: ID!
    name: String
}

type SomeError {
    message: String!
}
```

# Solution 1: Code generator

**Tool**: [code generator](https://github.com/kobylynskyi/graphql-java-codegen)

**Source code**: [Github](https://github.com/Andras-Csanyi/java_articles/tree/main/error_as_data_code_generator)

The tool here is the [graphql-java-codegen created by Kobylynskyi](https://github.com/kobylynskyi/graphql-java-codegen). The following code snippet is for demonstration purposes only, however it works.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.github.kobylynskyi</groupId>
    <artifactId>graphql-codegen-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>5.10.0</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <graphqlSchemas>
                    <rootDir>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/graphql/</rootDir>
                    <includePattern>.*\.graphqls?</includePattern>
                    <recursive>true</recursive>
                </graphqlSchemas>
                <outputDir>${project.basedir}/target/generated-sources/graphql</outputDir>
                <packageName>com.example.demo.model</packageName>
                <generateBuilder>true</generateBuilder>
                <generateJacksonTypeIdResolver>true</generateJacksonTypeIdResolver>
                <addGeneratedAnnotation>true</addGeneratedAnnotation>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

When the project is built it will generate the entities from the GraphQL schema. The important part is the following interface. The annotations below are added by the code generator due to the following section in the Maven config: `<generateJacksonTypeIdResolver>true</generateJacksonTypeIdResolver>`

```java
@javax.annotation.processing.Generated(
    value = "com.kobylynskyi.graphql.codegen.GraphQLCodegen",
    date = "2024-06-10T22:52:45+0200"
)
@com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo(
  use = com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, 
  property = "__typename")
@com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.annotation.JsonTypeIdResolver(
com.example.demo.model.GraphqlJacksonTypeIdResolver.class)
public interface ArticleResult {

}
```

At this point the application will work and the following query will result the result showed after the query.

```graphql
query {
  getArticlesSuccess {
    __typename
    ... on ArticleOutput {
      articles {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    ... on SomeError {
      message
    }
  }
  getArticlesError {
    __typename
    ... on ArticleOutput {
      articles {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    ... on SomeError {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see below both queries returned the `ArticleResult` implemented interface and Jackson just converted it to the proper types without any issue.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getArticlesSuccess": {
      "__typename": "ArticleOutput",
      "articles": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "name": "name1"
        },
        {
          "id": "2",
          "name": "name2"
        }
      ]
    },
    "getArticlesError": {
      "__typename": "SomeError",
      "message": "error happened"
    }
  }
}
```

# Solution 2: maintaining the entities by hand
