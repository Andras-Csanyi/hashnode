A few months ago I decided to use NeoVim. That time I did not know it is a commitment and not just a walk in the park.

My plan is that I'll use NeoVim as main IDE/editor and I'll be as fast and effective as possible. So, I also bought a [Kinesis Advantage 360](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/) keyboard as a gift for myself making a successful change in my career, going back to the light side (IC) from the dark side (management).

The other thing is to be able to use NeoVim in my daily Java job. My hobby projects are mainly Dotnet based. It means I need to have a valid and good setup for both languages. Java is difficult because IntelliJ is an awesome tool, but it is nothing compared to Rider, and having a Rider equivalent NeoVim setup for C# seems impossible now.

I have never learned touch typing with [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) (here is my [profile](https://www.keybr.com/profile/z1svzlf)) and it is an absolute must for the keyboard and NeoVim. So, I started learning it. At this moment, after 100 hours of practice, I can use all my fingers and type all the letter characters. This is a milestone, but not enough to use the keyboard as daily driver. At this moment I am slowing down further in typing speed to increase the precision above 99%. As precision stabilises my typing speed, currently around 40-60 wpm, will increase slowly. I am fine with this. Every single letter I type with this keyboard contributes my typing skills.

The next step of my touch typing journey is including capital letters. It requires me to find the right place for the `Shift` key and not have it at my pinkies. I need to find a place for it on the thumb cluster.

Once I have this and my typing speed with precision stabilise I'll include special characters like `.`, `"`, `;`, `:` and so on. This will be the point when I have to start working on layouts for IntelliJ with IdeaVim and NeoVim.

The whole process will take a year, but I am ok with it.
